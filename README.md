# Zen Tetris

Zen Tetris is yet another Tetris clone written in Python.
Sounds uninteresting?
I understand...but wait!  This is not an ordinary Tetris clone!
So, what's different about Zen Tetris?

* Cool, Zen-feeling opening view (Look at the drifting Buddha statue!)
* Good old 1-player mode with a stunning, rotating background.
* Exciting two-player battle mode (Yey!)

Um. Two of the three above items are thanks to beautiful images I borrowed from someone on the net. And by the way, this is my first Python program.
I hope you'll enjoy the game.

<h2>How to run game</h2>

* Download tet.py, images and sounds folder in the same folder
* pip3 install arcade --user
* python tet.py

<h2>How to play</h2>

Zen Tetris has two modes.
In 1-player mode, you can play a good, old Tetris
In 2-player battle mode, two players can "battle" with Tetris. If one player deletes more than one lines, (deleted lines - 1) lines will be added to the other player's play area. Wow, sounds exciting!
