<h1 id="zen-tetris">Zen Tetris</h1>
<p>Zen Tetris is yet another Tetris clone written in Python. Sounds uninteresting? I understand…but wait! This is not an ordinary Tetris clone! So, what’s different about Zen Tetris?</p>
<ul>
<li>Cool, Zen-feeling opening view (Look at the drifting Buddha statue!)</li>
<li>Good old 1-player mode with a stunning, rotating background.</li>
<li>Exciting two-player battle mode (Yey!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Um. Two of the three above items are thanks to beautiful images I borrowed from someone on the net. And by the way, this is my first Python program. I hope you’ll enjoy the game.</p>

How to play
</h2>
<p>Zen Tetris has two modes. In 1-player mode, you can play a good, old Tetris In 2-player battle mode, two players can “battle” with Tetris. If one player deletes more than one lines, (deleted lines - 1) lines will be added to the other player’s play area. Wow, sounds exciting!</p>
